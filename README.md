# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic game where the user has a certain amount of incorrect guesses to guess a word.

## Game Play

A random word is selected at the beginning of the game. The word the user needs to guess is displayed when the page loads as a set of underscores. To start the game click on any of the letters displayed on the screen. If the user clicks on a wrong letter it will be displayed where it says "Wrong Letters", and one star will be removed. The user has a total of 6 incorrect attempts. If the user clicks on a right letter it will be replace the underscore of where the position of that letter is. If the user guesses the word before losing the 6 stars, they win the game. If the user uses up their 6 incorrect attempts then the game is over.
